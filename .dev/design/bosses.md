# Bosses

The bosses in the game are based on the 21 Major Arcana Tarot cards. Seeing as
I'm a *major fucking nerd*, I'm using [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_Arcana)
as my first source for the info.

## 0. The Fool

### Patterns

Moves around with the same abilities as the player.

### Attacks

Granted one random ability that the player has. Biased towards 'weaker' ones
on lower levels, 'stronger' ones on higher levels.

## I. The Magician

### Patterns

Splits into four characters, with one being "real". Every time you hit the real
one the fakes all disappear.

### Attacks

Fires a projectile on one of the cardinal directions, more likely to fire on the
one that most closely lines up with the player.

## II. The High Priestess

Upon death, drops an upgrade to one of the player's current abilities.

### Patterns

## III. The Empress

### Patterns

Moves around like a (more limited) queen in chess.

### Attacks

Spawns monsters from a random pool. Less likely to spawn monsters the more
there are in the arena at present.

## IV. The Emperor

### Patterns

Moves evasively.

### Attacks

Randomly spawns 'walls' of 'pawns'. Monsters with one health that walk in a
straight line, not checking whether there are holes there. Will deal contact
damage to player.

## V. The High Priest

### Patterns

Moves around with a preset pattern, will not deviate, even to save self.

### Attacks

Randomly spawns "holy hand grenades" around the arena, which destroy the tiles
they are on and tiles within a certain radius based on the level.
